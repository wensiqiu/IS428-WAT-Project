          <h3>Project Motivation</h3>
          <p> With limited land space in Singapore, car ownership has always been a prevalent issue. Concerns with regards to land scarcity require a limited number of cars that can be driven on the road. We are interested to uncover the number of general car population in Singapore and investigate its trend over years. (2002 to 2012)</br></br>
				Which car brand is most preferred in Singapore and which brand is least preferred? With the implementation of policies (such as Green Vehicle Rebate Scheme) to promote the purchase of energy efficient vehicles, how did the number of car population map according to its fuel type?</p>

          <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
          <p>1.Identify the trend in car population as well as the rate of change over the past ten years.
2.Uncover the potential relationships (eg. car brands, fuel type etc) that different parameters have with regards to the purchase of cars in Singapore
3.We aim to cater to potential private car buyers, relevant authorities which include the Land Transport Authority and the suppliers of used cars in Singapore. </p>
